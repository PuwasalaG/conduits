#' conduits: CONDitional User Interface for Time Series normalisation
#' @description Methods and tools for conditional normalisation of time series using additive models.
#' This includes functions to estimate conditional means, conditional variances,
#' conditional autocorrelation functions and conditional cross-correlation functions.
#' Examples show these functions being used to estimate river flow time between two sensor locations in a river system.
