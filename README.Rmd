# conduits (CONDitional UI for Time Series normalization)

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

Package `conduits` provides an user interface for conditionally normalising a time series. This also facilitates functions to produce conditional cross-correlations between two normalised time series at different lags while providing some graphycal tools for visualisation. 

`conduits` can also be used to estimate the time delay between two sensor locations in river systems.  

## Installation

You can install `conduits` from github with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("PuwasalaG/conduits")
```
## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to use functions in `conduits`:
