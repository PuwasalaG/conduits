Package `conduits` provides an user interface for conditionally normalising a time series. This also facilitates functions to produce conditional cross-correlations between two normalised time series at different lags while providing some graphical tools for visualisation. 

`conduits` can also be used to estimate the time delay between two sensor locations in river systems.  

## Installation

You can install `conduits` from github with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("PuwasalaG/conduits")
```
## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to use functions in `conduits`:

`conduits` contains a set of water-quality variables measured by in-situ sensors from the Pringle Creek located in Wise County, Texas. This is one of the aquatic NEON field sites hosted by the US Forest Service. 

This data contains water-quality variables such as, turbidity, specific conductance, dissolved oxygen, pH and fDOM along with surface elevation and surface temperature from two sites located about 200m apart. Data are available from 2019-07-01 to 2019-12-31 at every 5 mintues. 

In this example we choose turbidity from upstream and downstream sites to calculate the cross-correlation while conditioning on level, temperature and conductance from the upstream location.  

Let us first prepare data as follows

```{r prepare_data}
library(conduits)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(mgcViz)
```

# Data

`conduits` contains `NEON_PRIN_5min_cleaned`, a set of water-quality variables measured by in-situ sensors from Pringle Creek located in Wise County, Texas. This is one of the aquatic NEON field sites hosted by the US Forest Service. 

This data contains water-quality variables such as turbidity, specific conductance, dissolved oxygen, pH and fDOM along with surface elevation and surface temperature from two sites located about 200m apart. Data are available from 2019-07-01 to 2019-12-31 at every 5 minutes. 

In this example, we choose turbidity from upstream and downstream sites to calculate the cross-correlation while conditioning on the water level, temperature and conductance from the upstream location.

Let us first prepare data as follows

```{r}
data <- NEON_PRIN_5min_cleaned |>
  filter(site == "upstream") |>
  select(
    Timestamp, turbidity, level,
    conductance, temperature
  ) 
head(data)
```

### Conditional normalisation

The following code shows how to normalise turbidity from a specific site.

```{r conditional_moments}
# Estimating conditional mean of the turbidity from the site given other measurements
fit_mean <- data |>
  conditional_mean(
    turbidity ~ s(level, k = 8) + s(conductance, k = 8) + s(temperature, k = 8)
  )
summary(fit_mean)

# Visualizing the fitted smooth functions in the conditional mean model
viz_mean <- getViz(fit_mean)
p <- plot(viz_mean, allTerms = TRUE) +
  l_points(size = 1, shape = 16, color = "gray") +
  l_fitLine(linetype = 1, color = "#0099FF") +
  l_ciLine(linetype = 3) +
  l_ciBar() +
  l_rug() +
  theme_grey()
print(p, pages=1)

# Estimating conditional variance of the turbidity from the site given other measurements
fit_var <- data |>
  conditional_var(
    turbidity ~ s(level, k = 7) + s(conductance, k = 7) + s(temperature, k = 7),
    family = "Gamma",
    fit_mean = fit_mean
  )
summary(fit_var)

# Normalize the series using conditional moments
new_ts <- data |>
  transmute(
    Timestamp = Timestamp,
    Normalized = normalize(data, turbidity, fit_mean, fit_var),
    Original = turbidity
  )

# Plot both the normalized and original series
new_ts |> 
  pivot_longer(-Timestamp, names_to = "variable", values_to = "Turbidity") |> 
  mutate(variable = factor(variable, levels = c("Original", "Normalized"))) |> 
  ggplot(aes(x=Timestamp, y=Turbidity)) +
  facet_grid(variable ~ ., scales = "free_y") +
  geom_line()
```

### Conditional cross-correlation

The following code shows how to compute conditional cross-correlation between upstream and downstream observations at given lags.

```{r}
old_ts <- NEON_PRIN_5min_cleaned |>
  select(
    Timestamp, site, turbidity, level,
    conductance, temperature
  ) |>
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = site,
    values_from = turbidity:temperature
  )
fit_mean_y <- old_ts |>
  conditional_mean(turbidity_downstream ~
    s(level_upstream, k = 8) +
    s(conductance_upstream, k = 8) +
    s(temperature_upstream, k = 8)
  )
fit_var_y <- old_ts |>
  conditional_var(
    turbidity_downstream ~
      s(level_upstream, k = 7) +
      s(conductance_upstream, k = 7) +
      s(temperature_upstream, k = 7),
    family = "Gamma",
    fit_mean = fit_mean_y
  )
fit_mean_x <- old_ts |>
  conditional_mean(turbidity_upstream ~
    s(level_upstream, k = 8) +
    s(conductance_upstream, k = 8) +
    s(temperature_upstream, k = 8)
  )
fit_var_x <- old_ts |>
  conditional_var(
    turbidity_upstream ~
      s(level_upstream, k = 7) +
      s(conductance_upstream, k = 7) +
      s(temperature_upstream, k = 7),
    family = "Gamma",
    fit_mean = fit_mean_x
  )
fit_c_ccf <- old_ts |>
  drop_na() |>
  conditional_ccf(
    I(turbidity_upstream * turbidity_downstream) ~ 
      splines::ns(level_upstream, df = 5) +
      splines::ns(temperature_upstream, df = 5),
    lag_max = 10,
    fit_mean_x = fit_mean_x, fit_var_x = fit_var_x, 
    fit_mean_y = fit_mean_y, fit_var_y = fit_var_y,
    df_correlation = c(5, 5)
  )
```

  mutate(name = factor(
    name,
    levels = c(
      "turbidity_downstream", "turbidity_upstream",
      "dt", "max_ccf"
    ),
    labels = c(
      "(a) Turbidity-downstream", "(b) Turbidity-upstream",
      "(c) Lag time (dt)", "(d) Maximum conditional cross-correlation"
    )
  )) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = Timestamp, y = value)) +
